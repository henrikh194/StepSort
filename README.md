# StepSort

So the idea is just to create a program in C which implements all sorts of funny and practical sorting algorithms and you should be able to try a new search alorithm at every step/iteration, you see where the name comes from.

This project is most entirely for my own learning purpose.

At this moment its a big WIP project, I cant garuntee if its ever ready, but maybe maybe. <3
