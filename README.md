# StepSort

So the idea is just to create a program in C which implements all sorts of funny and practical sorting algorithms, and you should be able to try a new search algorithm at every step/iteration. You see where the name comes from. ;)

This project is most entirely for my own learning purpose.

At this moment it's a big WIP project, I cant guarantee if its ever ready, but maybe maybe. <3
